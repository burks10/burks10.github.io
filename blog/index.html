        I never would have thought I'd start my own blog, but with my final semester of school coming to a close and a new chapter in my life opening up, I decided to give it a stab. (In typical developer fashion of course.)
        <br><br>
        It's about 8 O'clock on a Tuesday during reading week, and I finally got the theme of this blog the way I want. There's a bit more that I want to do, such as add in a sticky navbar and some contact links, but overall I think it's pretty good. Shout out to Goutham for the awesome mock up he/she posted on Dribble, you can check him/her out <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2421209-Blog-Post">here</a>.
        Anyways, I wasn't really sure what to base this blog post on, but I figured why not talk about how I got into development in the first place.
<br><br>
        Rewinding back about 7 years now I was in grade 10 at Galt Collegiate Institute in downtown Cambridge. One of my good friends was taking an intro to programming course where he was learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language)">Turing</a>. If there are any newbie programmers out there reading this, I highly suggest checking the language out. It's super beginner friendly and
        teaches you quite a bit about the general constructs of development. Anyways, my good friend was working on an assignment that he had for the course during our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-subject_instructional_period">MSIP</a> period, and it happened to catch my eye. He had a red ball on a completely blank window and beside that was a few lines of what was essentially complete gibberish to me.
        The assignment tasked him with creating a program that made a ball bounce around the edges of the screen. I was completely intrigued. It amazed me that he had so much power over what the computer could do. Over the remainder of the period I sat watching him repeatedly typing lines, hitting run, then observing the output, until finally it was finished. There was one red ball moving at a constant velocity,
        and changing direction whenever it hit a wall. It was truly amazing to me at the time.
        <br><br>
        That night after watching my friend whip up that program, I instantly started googling for any information on learning Turing. I came across this site <a href="http://compsci.ca">compsci.ca</a> where I found <a href="http://compsci.ca/v3/viewtopic.php?t=8808">this exact walkthrough</a>. Looking back at the tutorials, and even the website in general, none of it has changed one bit over the past 7 years! Over the next several weeks, I went through most of the tutorials in the walkthrough and
        learned more than what I would have in Grade 10 programming class. In grade 11 and 12 I learned Java and was instantly hooked on the language. For my final project in Grade 11 I made a clone of the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_(video_game)">Donkey Kong game.</a> I actually still have the code and find it amazing (and disturbing) that I managed to make the whole game inside 1 method!
        I guess there was technically 3, but the main method literally called a constructor method in another class to initialize the game canvas. Anyways, the game worked and I was super happy with the result. It was my very first game that I made without following an online tutorial.
        <br><br>
        After finishing up that project, I was very interested to figure out how 3D games were made. My friend and I stumbled across a 3D Java game engine called <a href="http://jmonkeyengine.org/">JMonkey Engine</a>. We both were interested in making a first person shooter so we set out and gave it our best shot (no pun intended). In the end we actually ended up with something decently cool. There was a small town with extremely low quality
        textures, an extremely out of scale ogre that followed you wherever you went, and a first person character holding an AK47. There were a couple features/bugs, including the ability to rotate your character upside down, a gun in which overtime moved off screen due to the bad recoil animation and a couple more, but who cares, we were just happy we made something.
        <br><br>
        So that was my humble beginning. Now that I've reminisced in my final years of high school, I have an itch to go try Turing again! Maybe my next blog will be about what Turing is like after coding in "real" languages for the past 7 years...
